# Unmedium

**This project is still WIP**

We all know medium right? A bunch of JS, wasted space and other stuff you don't want.
Ever ran out of data volume on your phone and tried to load a medium post? Well, good luck!

## Concept

This project consists of two components.

1. An extension that recognizes you are trying to load a medium website and redirect you to the optimized version.
2. A backend that caches optimized and minified variants of medium posts.

The goal is to allow everyone to quickly load a medium post, but still link back to medium and give credit to the author.
There's no intent to make any money with this project. You can self-host this
and share the links with your friends and coworkers if you want to. I advise against
hosting this publicly available to everyone, as neither the authors or medium will appreciate that ;)
